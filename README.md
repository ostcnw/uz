Unlimited Za. Website

uz.iteam.live to view production website. Keep in mind any changes made on the <strong>Main</strong> Branch will automatically update to the live site.. Use a different branch to test and prototype.

<h1>What the heck is a branch?</h1>
A branch is a seperate "version" of your app/software away from the main branch (in our case the branch that automatically uploads to the live website), allowing you to test and collaborate changes before you upload to the main branch.

Remember: <b>Google is your friend</b>. When you are developing software or apps in the future, you will most certainly have to use tools you have not heard of before. Googling documentation for these tools is almost a necessity, and there is no shame in doing so. Even if you are using a toolset you are familiar with, google may provide the best and most efficient/time saving solutions to your problem/task. View the Github documentation here to learn more about branches. https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches

If you have any questions on how anything works, or how the website automatically gets uploaded. Ask Mr. Matousek
